Economic Characteristics 
    The four economic characteristics of real property that affect its value as a product in the marketplace are scarcity, improvements, permanence of investment, and area preference. 

Scarcity 
    While a considerable amount of land has not been developed, the supply in a given location that is suitable for a particular use is finite. 
    There is also value in leaving land in its natural condition to preserve species that might otherwise be extinguished, as well as to benefit the earth's environment overall. 

Improvements 
    Building an improvement on one parcel of land can affect the land's value and use, as well as that of neighbroing tracts and whole communities. 
        For example, constructing a new business center or selecting a site for toxic waste storage can dramatically change the value of land in a large area. 

Permanence of investment
    The capital and labor used to build an improvement represent a large fixed investment. Although even a well-built structure can be razed to make way for a newer buidling, improvements such a sdrainage, electricty, water, and sewerage remain. 
    The return on such investmnets tends to be long term and relatively stable. 

Area Preference 
    Also known as situs ("place"), area preference is commonly referred to as "location, location, location." 
    This economic characteristic refers not only to geography but also to the preference for a specific area. 
    Area preference is based on several factors, such as convenience, reputaion, and history. 
    It is the unique quality of these preferences taht results in the different price points for similar properties.
    Location is often considered the single most important economic characteristic of land.
