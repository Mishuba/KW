Real Property 
    The interests, benefits, and rights that are automatically included in the ownership of real estate. (See Land, Real Estate, and Real Property.)
    In many states, the terms real estate and real property are synonymous, and are used to refer to both the physical property and the rights of ownership, while other states still make the distinction.

    Traditionally, ownership rights of real property are described as a bundle of legal rights. 
        These Rights Include 
            Right of Poessession 
            Right to control the property within the framework of the law. 
            Right of enjoyment (to use the property in any legal manner),
            Right of exclusion (to keep others from entering or using the property), and 
            Right of Disposition (to sell, will, transfer, or otherwise dispose of or encumber the property). 

    TItle to Real Property 
        The word TITLE, as it relates to real property (real estate), has two meaning: 
            (1) the right to or ownership of the property, including the owner's bundle of legal rights; and 
            (2) evidence of that ownership by a deed. 
        TITLE refers to ownership of the property, not to a printed document.
        The document by which the owner transfers title to the property is the deed. 

    The Bundle of Legal Rights 
        Real property is often coupled with the word APPURTENANCE. 
        An appurtenance (something that is transferred with or "runs with" the land) is a right or privilege associated with the property, although not necessarily a physical part of it.  
        Typical appurtenances include parking spaces in multiunit buildings, easements, water rights, and other improvements. 
        An appurtenance is connected to the property, and ownership of the appurtenance normally transfers to the new owner when the property is sold.
