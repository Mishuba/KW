Preclosing Procedures 
    Closing involves two major events. First, the promises made in the sales contract are fulfilled; second, the mortgage funds are distributed to the buyer. Before the property changes hands, however, each party—buyer and seller—usually will have specific concerns that must be addressed. As emphasized previously, the closing process is based on the provisions of the sales contract, making it important that the parties treat the negotiation for the purchase of the property—the process of offer and acceptance—very seriously.
    Many real estate professionals maintain a list of events that must take place prior to the actual closing in order to avoid surprises that might lead to delays.

    Buyer's Concerns 
        Both the buyer and the buyer's lender must be sure that the seller can deliver the title that was promised in the purchase agreement and that the property is now in essentially the same condition it was in when the buyer and the seller agreed to the sale. A home inspection will alert the buyer to any issues that were not immediately apparent when the buyer viewed the property, as well as problems with mechanical systems that an inspection may reveal.
        The buyer's concerns thus involve examination of examination of
            the results of any inspections, such as termite, radon, water and septic systems, structural inspections, or required repairs;
            the survey;
            the title evidence, including the seller's deed and any documents demonstrating the removal of undesired liens and encumbrances; and
            any lease, if a tenant resides on the premises.
        A thorough inspection of the property by a professional home inspector, who may have to be licensed by the state, may allay many of the buyer's concerns, or identify problems to be resolved. 
            
    Final Property Inspection 
        In the real estate contract, the buyer usually reserves the right to make a final inspection, often called a walk-through, shortly before the closing takes place. The buyer, accompanied by the real estate professional, verifies that necessary repairs have been made, that the property has been well maintained, that all fixtures are in place, and that no unauthorized removal or alteration of any part of the improvements has taken place. It is not a time to reopen negotiations, but to verify that the condition of the property is in compliance with the terms of the contract.

    Survey 
        A survey provides information about the exact location and size of the property. Typically, the survey indicates the location of all buildings, driveways, fences, and other improvements located on the premises. The survey should also indicate any existing easements and encroachments. The cost of the survey is negotiated in the sales contract. The survey is important in verifying the legal description of the property.
            In Practice
                Relying on an old survey is not a good idea; the property should be resurveyed prior to closing, even in the rare instance that it is not required by the title company or lender. A current survey confirms that the property purchased is exactly what the buyer wants and that no encroachments have arisen since the last transfer of title.

    Title Evidence 
        The buyer and the buyer's lender will require that the seller's title comply with the terms of the real estate contract. Although practices vary from state to state, most require that the seller produce a current abstract of title or title commitment from a title insurance company. When an abstract of title is used, the purchaser's attorney examines it and issues an opinion of title. The attorney's opinion of title is a statement of the quality of the seller's title, and it lists all liens, encumbrances, easements, conditions, and restrictions that appear in the record and to which the seller's title is subject. The attorney's opinion is not a guarantee of title. You previously learned about how ownership is proven and the importance of examining the chain of title for various defects.
        When the purchaser pays cash or obtains a new loan to purchase the property, the seller's existing loan is paid in full and satisfied on the record. The exact amount required to pay the existing loan is provided in a current payoff statement from the lender, effective the date of closing. The payoff statement notes the unpaid amount of principal, the interest due through the date of the proposed payment, the fee for issuing the certificate of satisfaction or release deed, credits to the seller (if any) for tax and insurance reserves, and the amount of any prepayment penalty. The same procedure is followed for any other liens, such as a second mortgage or home equity loan, that must be released before the buyer takes title.
        If the buyer assumes the seller's existing mortgage loan, the buyer needs to know the exact balance of the loan as of the closing date. Usually, the lender is required to provide the buyer with a mortgage reduction certificate, which certifies the amount owed on the mortgage loan, the interest rate, and the date and amount of the last interest payment.
        The closing agent examines the title commitment or the abstract that was issued several days or weeks before the closing. Because liens may have been filed during the interval, two searches of the public record are often made. The first search shows the status of the seller's title on that date. The second search, known as a bring down, is made after the closing and before any new documents are filed.
        As part of the later search, the seller may be required to execute an affidavit of title, a sworn statement in which the seller assures the title insurance company (and the buyer) that no other defects in the title have occurred since the date of the title examination (e.g., judgments, bankruptcies, divorce, unrecorded deeds or contracts, unpaid repairs or improvements that might lead to mechanics' liens). The affidavit gives the title insurance company a basis on which to sue the seller should the statements in the affidavit be incorrect.
        In areas in which real estate sales transactions are customarily closed through an escrow, the escrow instructions usually provide for an extended coverage policy to be issued to the buyer effective the date of closing. The seller then has no need to execute an affidavit of title.
            In Practice
                Real estate professionals often assist in preclosing arrangements as part of their service to customers. In some states, real estate professionals are required to advise the parties of the approximate expenses involved in closing when a real estate sales contract is signed. In other states, real estate professionals have a statutory duty to coordinate and supervise closing activities. Aside from state laws on this issue, a real estate professional without a specific role in the closing may still be the person with the greatest knowledge of the details of the transaction. Because of this, many real estate professionals feel it is part of their fiduciary duty to be present at a face-to-face closing.


    Seller's Concerns 
        The seller's main interest is to receive payment for the property, so the seller will want assurance that the buyer has obtained the necessary financing and will have sufficient funds to complete the sale. In turn, the seller may have a list of tasks required by the purchase agreement to complete. Unless the seller owns the property free and clear of any mortgage debt, there must also be a payoff statement from the seller's lender(s), noting the amount owed that will be paid out of the sale proceeds. Both parties, along with their attorneys or real estate professionals, will want to inspect the disclosure statement made prior to closing to make sure that all monies involved in the transaction have been accounted for properly.

    Real Estate Professional's Role At Closing 
        Depending on local practice, the real estate professional's role at closing can vary from simply collecting the commission to conducting the proceedings. In the states that require an attorney's participation, a real estate professional's responsibility is essentially finished as soon as the real estate contract is signed. Even so, most real estate professionals continue to be involved all the way through closing on behalf of their clients because it is also in a real estate professional's best interest that the transaction moves successfully and smoothly to a conclusion. This may mean actively arranging for title evidence, surveys, appraisals, and inspections or repairs related to structural conditions, water supplies, sewage facilities, or toxic substances.
        Although real estate professionals do not always conduct closing proceedings, they usually attend. Often, the parties look to their real estate professionals for guidance, assistance, and information during what can be a stressful experience. Real estate professionals must be thoroughly familiar with the procedures involved in preparing the disclosure statement provided prior to closing, including the proration of costs involved in closing the transaction, which will be discussed later.
            In Practice
                Even in a state that does not require an attorney at closing, the real estate professional should never discourage the seller's or the buyer's use of an attorney, before and/or at closing. The real estate professional can, however, provide guidance on the importance of selecting a competent, experienced real estate attorney. The attorney must be knowledgeable about real estate documents and closing practices in order for the transaction to close smoothly.

    Lender's Interest in Closing
        Whether a buyer obtains new financing or assumes the seller's existing loan, the lender wants to protect its security interest in the property and ensure that its mortgage lien has priority over other liens. The lender may require a survey, a pest control or another inspection report, or a certificate of occupancy (for a newly constructed building). In order to ensure that the buyer takes good and marketable title at closing, lenders generally require that the buyer obtain a mortgagee's title insurance policy.
        The buyer must also provide a fire and hazard insurance policy (along with a receipt for the premium). Usually, the homeowners insurance policy the buyer purchases combines the required hazard insurance on the structure, as well as insurance on the buyer's personal property.
        The lender typically will request that a reserve account be established for tax and insurance payments so that the buyer sets aside funds for these large expenses of homeownership. The lender may even require representation by its own attorney at closing.

    Internal Revenue Service Reporting Requirements
        Certain real estate closings must be reported to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on Form 1099-S. The affected properties include a sale or exchange of
            land (improved or unimproved), including air space;
            an inherently permanent structure, including any residential, commercial, or industrial building;
            a condominium unit and its appurtenant fixtures and common elements (including land); or
            shares in a cooperative housing corporation.
        Information to be reported includes the sales price, the amount of property tax reimbursement credited to the seller, and the seller's Social Security number. If the closing agent does not notify the IRS, the responsibility for filing the form falls on the mortgage lender, although the real estate professionals or the parties to the transaction ultimately could be held liable.


Conducting the Closing 
    Closing is known by different names in different areas. In some areas, for instance, closing is called settlement and transfer. The closing process also takes different forms, depending on state law, local custom, or the convenience of the parties. In some parts of the country, the parties to a transaction sit around a table and exchange copies of documents as they are executed, a process known as passing papers. ("We passed papers on the new house Wednesday morning.") In other regions, the buyer and the seller never meet; the paperwork is handled by an escrow agent in a process known as closing escrow. ("We'll close escrow on our house next week.") The main concerns are always that the buyer receive marketable title and the seller receive the purchase price.
        
    Face-to-Face Closing 
        A face-to-face closing may be held at the office of the title company, the lending institution, an attorney for one of the parties, the real estate professional, the county recorder, or the escrow company. In many cases, this is the first and only time the buyer and the seller will meet. Those attending a closing may include
            the buyer;
            the seller;
            the real estate professionals (both the buyer's and the seller's representatives);
            the seller's and the buyer's attorneys;
            a representative of the lending institution involved with the buyer's new mortgage loan, the buyer's assumption of the seller's existing loan, or the seller's payoff of an existing loan; and
            a representative of the title insurance company.

    Closing agent or closing officer 
        The closing agent may be a representative of the title company or lender, the real estate professional representing one of the parties, or the buyer's or the seller's attorney. Some title companies and law firms employ paralegal assistants who conduct closings for their firms.
        The closing agent orders and reviews the title insurance policy or title certificate, survey, property insurance policy, and other items. After the sales contract is reviewed, the disclosure statement that indicates the division of income and expenses between the parties is prepared. Finally, the time and place of closing is arranged.

    The Exchange 
        The exchange is made when the parties are satisfied that everything is in order. After the buyer and the seller have signed all the necessary paperwork, the seller delivers the signed deed to the buyer, who accepts it. All pertinent documents are then recorded in the correct order to ensure continuity of title. For instance, if the seller pays off an existing loan and the buyer obtains a new loan, the seller's satisfaction of mortgage must be recorded before the seller's deed to the buyer. Because the buyer cannot pledge the property as security for the new loan until ownership has been transferred, the buyer's new mortgage or deed of trust is recorded only after the seller's deed to the buyer is recorded.
            In Practice 
                A face-to-face or roundtable closing can be challenging and may not be the best approach to use if there has been friction between buyer and seller leading up to the closing. In addition, there may be a confidentiality or privacy concern in having all parties present to hear all discussions, questions asked, or concerns raised. Having the closing agent ferry documents between separate rooms in which each of the parties and their representatives are sequestered may be the best way to avoid any risk of conflict at such a stressful moment.

    Closing in escrow 
        In an escrow closing, a disinterested third party is authorized to act as escrow agent, or escrow holder, and coordinate the closing activities. The selection of the escrow agent is determined by negotiation, custom, or state law. The escrow agent may be an attorney, a title company, a trust company, an escrow company, or the escrow department of a lending institution. Although a few states do not permit certain transactions to be closed in escrow, escrow closings are used to some extent in most states.

    Escrow Procedure 
        After the sales contract is signed, the buyer and seller execute escrow instructions to the escrow agent. Once the escrow instructions are received by the escrow agent, they can be changed only at the written direction of both buyer and seller. The real estate professional who is holding the earnest money turns it over to the escrow agent, who deposits it in a special trust, or escrow, account.
        The buyer and the seller deposit all pertinent documents and other items with the escrow agent before the specified date of closing.
        The seller deposits
            the deed conveying the property to the buyer;
            title evidence (abstract and attorney's opinion of title, certificate of title, title insurance, or Torrens certificate);
            existing hazard insurance policies;
            a letter or mortgage reduction certificate from the lender stating the exact principal remaining (if the buyer is assuming the seller's loan);
            affidavits of title (if required);
            a payoff statement (if the seller's loan is to be paid off); and
            other instruments or documents necessary to clear the title or to complete the transaction.
        The buyer deposits
            the balance of the cash needed to complete the purchase, usually in the form of a certified check;
            loan documents (if the buyer secures a new loan);
            proof of hazard insurance, including (where required) flood insurance; and
            other necessary documents, such as inspection reports required by the lender.
        The escrow agent has the authority to examine the title evidence. When marketable title is shown in the name of the buyer, all other conditions of the escrow agreement have been met, and the parties have received the disclosure statement, the agent is authorized to disburse the purchase price to the seller, minus all charges and expenses. The agent then records the deed and, if a new loan has been obtained by the buyer, the mortgage or deed of trust.
        If the escrow agent's examination of the title discloses liens, a portion of the purchase price can be withheld from the seller. The withheld portion is used to pay the liens to clear the title.
        If the seller cannot clear the title, or if for any reason the sale cannot be consummated, the escrow instructions usually provide that the parties be returned to their former status, as if no sale occurred. The escrow agent returns the documents of title to the seller and returns the purchase money to the buyer.
