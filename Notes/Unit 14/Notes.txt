Preclosing Procedures 
    Closing involves two major events. First, the promises made in the sales contract are fulfilled; second, the mortgage funds are distributed to the buyer. Before the property changes hands, however, each party—buyer and seller—usually will have specific concerns that must be addressed. As emphasized previously, the closing process is based on the provisions of the sales contract, making it important that the parties treat the negotiation for the purchase of the property—the process of offer and acceptance—very seriously.
    Many real estate professionals maintain a list of events that must take place prior to the actual closing in order to avoid surprises that might lead to delays.

    Buyer's Concerns 
        Both the buyer and the buyer's lender must be sure that the seller can deliver the title that was promised in the purchase agreement and that the property is now in essentially the same condition it was in when the buyer and the seller agreed to the sale. A home inspection will alert the buyer to any issues that were not immediately apparent when the buyer viewed the property, as well as problems with mechanical systems that an inspection may reveal.
        The buyer's concerns thus involve examination of examination of
            the results of any inspections, such as termite, radon, water and septic systems, structural inspections, or required repairs;
            the survey;
            the title evidence, including the seller's deed and any documents demonstrating the removal of undesired liens and encumbrances; and
            any lease, if a tenant resides on the premises.
        A thorough inspection of the property by a professional home inspector, who may have to be licensed by the state, may allay many of the buyer's concerns, or identify problems to be resolved. 
            
    Final Property Inspection 
        In the real estate contract, the buyer usually reserves the right to make a final inspection, often called a walk-through, shortly before the closing takes place. The buyer, accompanied by the real estate professional, verifies that necessary repairs have been made, that the property has been well maintained, that all fixtures are in place, and that no unauthorized removal or alteration of any part of the improvements has taken place. It is not a time to reopen negotiations, but to verify that the condition of the property is in compliance with the terms of the contract.

    Survey 
    A survey provides information about the exact location and size of the property. Typically, the survey indicates the location of all buildings, driveways, fences, and other improvements located on the premises. The survey should also indicate any existing easements and encroachments. The cost of the survey is negotiated in the sales contract. The survey is important in verifying the legal description of the property.
        In Practice
            Relying on an old survey is not a good idea; the property should be resurveyed prior to closing, even in the rare instance that it is not required by the title company or lender. A current survey confirms that the property purchased is exactly what the buyer wants and that no encroachments have arisen since the last transfer of title.

    Title Evidence 
    The buyer and the buyer's lender will require that the seller's title comply with the terms of the real estate contract. Although practices vary from state to state, most require that the seller produce a current abstract of title or title commitment from a title insurance company. When an abstract of title is used, the purchaser's attorney examines it and issues an opinion of title. The attorney's opinion of title is a statement of the quality of the seller's title, and it lists all liens, encumbrances, easements, conditions, and restrictions that appear in the record and to which the seller's title is subject. The attorney's opinion is not a guarantee of title. You previously learned about how ownership is proven and the importance of examining the chain of title for various defects.
    When the purchaser pays cash or obtains a new loan to purchase the property, the seller's existing loan is paid in full and satisfied on the record. The exact amount required to pay the existing loan is provided in a current payoff statement from the lender, effective the date of closing. The payoff statement notes the unpaid amount of principal, the interest due through the date of the proposed payment, the fee for issuing the certificate of satisfaction or release deed, credits to the seller (if any) for tax and insurance reserves, and the amount of any prepayment penalty. The same procedure is followed for any other liens, such as a second mortgage or home equity loan, that must be released before the buyer takes title.
    If the buyer assumes the seller's existing mortgage loan, the buyer needs to know the exact balance of the loan as of the closing date. Usually, the lender is required to provide the buyer with a mortgage reduction certificate, which certifies the amount owed on the mortgage loan, the interest rate, and the date and amount of the last interest payment.
    The closing agent examines the title commitment or the abstract that was issued several days or weeks before the closing. Because liens may have been filed during the interval, two searches of the public record are often made. The first search shows the status of the seller's title on that date. The second search, known as a bring down, is made after the closing and before any new documents are filed.
    As part of the later search, the seller may be required to execute an affidavit of title, a sworn statement in which the seller assures the title insurance company (and the buyer) that no other defects in the title have occurred since the date of the title examination (e.g., judgments, bankruptcies, divorce, unrecorded deeds or contracts, unpaid repairs or improvements that might lead to mechanics' liens). The affidavit gives the title insurance company a basis on which to sue the seller should the statements in the affidavit be incorrect.
    In areas in which real estate sales transactions are customarily closed through an escrow, the escrow instructions usually provide for an extended coverage policy to be issued to the buyer effective the date of closing. The seller then has no need to execute an affidavit of title.
        In Practice
            Real estate professionals often assist in preclosing arrangements as part of their service to customers. In some states, real estate professionals are required to advise the parties of the approximate expenses involved in closing when a real estate sales contract is signed. In other states, real estate professionals have a statutory duty to coordinate and supervise closing activities. Aside from state laws on this issue, a real estate professional without a specific role in the closing may still be the person with the greatest knowledge of the details of the transaction. Because of this, many real estate professionals feel it is part of their fiduciary duty to be present at a face-to-face closing.
