People buy homes for a variety of reasons.
To many people, home ownership is a sign of financial stability.
A home is an investment that can apprecite in value, especially over many years of ownership.
Even when a loan is necessary to be able to afford the purchase of a home, the interest paid on the loan may be a useful deduction from federal income tax.
Home ownership also offers benefits that may be less tangible but no less valuable, such as pride, security, and a sense of belonging to a community.

Financial constraints limit many people to leasing rather than buying a home.
Some like the flexibility offered by a lease, or the amenities offered by a housing development or neighborhodd where renting is a viable alternative to home purchase. 
Renting also means less initial financial commitment, mkaing it possible to use funds for business investment or other purposes.
