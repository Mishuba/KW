Buying

Leasing



Sidenote:
    The most common type fo real estate transaction is the purchase of a home or residential property.

    Although it is possible for a single real estate firm or an individual real estate professional to perform all the services and handle all classes of property discussed here (unless restricted by a state's license law), this is rarely done.
    A variety of services may be available within the same real estate firm in small towns, but most firms and professionals specialize to some degree.
