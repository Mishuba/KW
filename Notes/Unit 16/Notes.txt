Appraising
- An appraisal is an opinion of value based on supportable evidence and approved methods. An appraisal report is an opinion of market value on a property given to a lender or client with detailed market information. An appraiser is an independent professional trained to provide an unbiased opinion of value in an impartial and objective manner, following an identified appraisal process. Appraising is a professional service performed for a fee; it is a breach of accepted practice and ethics to collect a commission for an appraisal based on the value of the property appraised.

- An accurate, objective appraisal is an important part of a real estate transaction, as well as a safeguard against a fraudulent transaction. The Dodd-Frank Act required changes to the Truth in Lending Act and other legislation to prohibit the coercion and other activities that influenced appraisals in many cases of fraud that occurred during the housing crisis of the past decade. Fannie Mae initiated Appraiser Independence Requirements (AIR) that took effect October 15, 2010. A copy of the AIR can be found at www.fanniemae.com/content/fact_sheet/appraiser-independence-requirements.pdf.

   Regulation of appraisal activities
         - Title XI of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) requires that any appraisal used in connection with a federally related transaction be performed by a competent individual who is licensed or certified by the state in which the appraiser practices. Every state now has an appraiser licensing agency, which is required by FIRREA to be separate from the agency that licenses real estate professionals.
         - A federally related transaction is any real estate-related financial transaction in which a federal financial institution or regulatory agency is engaged. These transactions involve the sale, lease, purchase, investment, or exchange of real property. They also include the use of real property as security for a loan or an investment, including mortgage-backed securities. Appraisals of residential property valued at $250,000 or less are exempt and need not be performed by licensed or certified appraisers. Nonresidential properties valued at more than $250,000 (raised to $500,000 in 2018) require a certified appraiser.
         - There are limited exceptions to the appraisal requirements. Fannie Mae will not require a new appraisal for a limited cash-out refinancing when borrower and lender are the same, the original appraisal was performed no more than 12 months earlier (if performed more than four months earlier, an appraisal update is required), and the property should be in substantially the same condition (no significant updates or deterioration) that would affect market value.
         - Given the many properties that have had appraisals entered in Fannie Mae's Collateral Underwriter (CU) database, some loans purchased by Fannie Mae are eligible for a property inspection waiver (PIW). Fannie Mae's Desktop Underwriter (DU) system will search the property address for an appraisal; if the first and last names of the borrowers on the earlier and present loan match, Fannie Mae will consider a PIW. If the earlier appraisal was flagged for any reason (perhaps an over valuation), the PIW will not be issued.

   Appraiser Qualifications
         - State licensing and certification criteria for appraisers must conform to the requirements of the Appraisal Subcommittee of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, as recommended by the Appraiser Qualifications Board (AQB) of the Appraisal Foundation. The Appraisal Foundation is a not-for-profit organization composed of representatives of the major appraisal and related groups. In conducting an appraisal, an appraiser must follow the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) established by the Appraisal Standards Board (ASB) of the Appraisal Foundation. Members of the AQB meet regularly to review and make recommendations for changes to the level of education and experience required of appraisers. Members of the ASB also meet often to discuss revisions and updates to USPAP. Both of these boards are composed of practicing appraisers, state officials, and educators. The Appraisal Foundation has also created the Appraisal Practices Board (APB), which "offers voluntary guidance to appraisers, regulators and users of appraisal services on recognized valuation methods and techniques for all valuation disciplines."
         - More information about the Appraisal Foundation and links to all of the Appraisal Foundation boards can be found at www.appraisalfoundation.org. USPAP undergoes review and revision in a two-year cycle starting with an even-numbered year; the current update can be found at www.uspap.org.

  Organizations for Appraisers
        - Most appraisers work as independent contractors, even when they are employed by a large appraisal management company, but appraisers are also employed by public agencies. Numerous trade associations are available for appraisers and are valuable sources of education, legal updates, and networking opportunities. Some of the largest are the following:

      - American Society of Appraisers—www.appraisers.org
      - American Society of Farm Managers and Rural Appraisers, Inc.—www.asfmra.org
      - Appraisal Institute—www.appraisalinstitute.org
      - International Association of Assessing Officers—www.iaao.org
      - International Right of Way Association—www.irwaonline.org
      - National Association of Independent Fee Appraisers—www.naifa.com

Competitive Marketing Analysis
      - Not all estimates of value are made by professional appraisers. As you have already learned, real estate professionals often prepare a comparative market analysis (CMA) for a seller or buyer. A CMA is distinctly different from an appraisal report offered by a licensed or certified appraiser. An appraisal is based on a detailed analysis of market conditions, the features of the subject property and comparable properties in the neighborhood, recent sales and listings, land value and current construction cost—all the elements that a lender wants to consider in determining whether or not to make a loan and accept the property as security for the debt. The CMA focuses on properties similar to the subject property in size, location, and amenities for the purpose of deriving a likely listing price or offering price. The CMA analysis is based on

      • recently closed properties (solds),
      • properties currently on the market (competition for the subject property), and
      • properties that did not sell (expired listings in the area).

Broker Price Option (BPO)
- A broker's price opinion (BPO) is a less-expensive alternative for evaluating property that is often used by lenders working with home equity lines, refinancing, portfolio management, loss mitigation, and collections. Although some BPOs are more extensive, including information about the neighborhood and an interior analysis, many are simply "drive bys" that verify the existence of the property, along with a listing of comparable sales. A BPO should not be confused with an appraisal, which consists of more in-depth analysis of gathered information and which may be performed only by a licensed or certified appraiser. A BPO cannot be used if the matter involves a federally related transaction that requires an appraisal and/or the transaction occurs in a state that requires one. Information on how a BPO is used in certain Fannie Mae programs, perhaps a short sale or deed in lieu of foreclosure, can be obtained by entering "BPO" in the search box at www.fanniemae.com/singlefamily.
