Special assessments and local improvement district taxes

A special assessment is a tax charged on real estate to fund public improvements to the property, and it creates a lien for the amount of the assessment on the property. Property owners in the improvement area are required to pay for the improvements because their properties benefit directly from them. For example, the construction of paved streets, curbs, gutters, sidewalks, storm sewers, or street lighting increases the value of properties that benefit from them. The additional tax paid by the homeowner of those properties covers the cost of the improvements.

A special assessment is generally paid in equal annual installments over a period of years. The first installment is usually due during the year following the public authority's approval of the assessment. The first bill includes one year's interest on the property owner's share of the entire assessment. Subsequent bills include one year's interest on the unpaid balance. Property owners have the right to prepay any or all installments to avoid future interest charges.

For large-scale improvement projects such as streets, sidewalks, and water or sewer construction, a local improvement district (LID) may be created. An LID is a specific geographical area formed by a group of property owners working together to fund needed capital improvements. LID taxation is simply a financing method available for the design and construction of public improvements.

In some parts of the country, strict subdivision regulations and LIDs have just about eliminated special assessments. Most items for which assessments have traditionally been levied are now required to be installed at the time of construction as a condition of a subdivision's approval.

15.3 Notes
Mortgage Lien
- A mortgage lien is a specific, voluntary lien on real estate given to a lender by a borrower as security for a real estate loan. It becomes a lien on real property when the lender records the documents in the county where the property is located. Lenders generally require a preferred lien, called a first mortgage lien. This means that no other liens against the property (aside from real estate taxes) can take priority over the mortgage lien. As mentioned earlier, subsequent liens are referred to as junior liens.

Mechanic Lien
- A mechanic's lien is a specific, involuntary lien that gives security to persons or companies that perform labor or furnish material to improve real property. A mechanic's lien is available to contractors, subcontractors, architects, equipment lessors, surveyors, laborers, and other providers. This type of lien is filed when the owner has not fully paid for the work or when the general contractor has been compensated but has not paid the subcontractors or suppliers of materials. Statutes in some states prohibit subcontractors from placing liens directly on certain types of property, such as owner-occupied residences. While laws regarding mechanics' liens vary from state to state, there are many similarities.

- To be entitled to a mechanic's lien, the person who did the work must have had a contract with the owner or the owner's authorized representative, such as a general contractor. A person claiming a mechanic's lien must file a notice of lien in the public record of the county where the property is located within a certain time after the work has been completed. A lien waiver is required for a contractor to receive a payment from the owner's construction loan. Once the work is completed and accounts paid, the owner will ask for a release or satisfaction of lien to be filed to clear the property title.

- According to state law, priority of a mechanic's lien may be established as of the date the construction began or materials were first furnished; the date the work was completed; the date the individual subcontractor's work was either commenced or completed; the date the contract was signed or work was ordered; or the date a notice of the lien was recorded, filed, posted, or served. In some states, mechanics' liens may be given priority over previously recorded liens, such as mortgages.

- If improvements that were not ordered by the property owner have commenced, the property owner should execute a document called a notice of nonresponsibility to be relieved from possible mechanics' liens. By posting this notice in some conspicuous place on the property and recording a verified copy of it in the public record within the time specified by statute, the owner gives notice that he or she is not responsible for the work done. This may prevent the filing of mechanics' liens on the property.

- In Practice

- In most states, a mechanic's lien takes priority from the time it attaches, even though a claimant's notice of lien will not be filed in the public record until sometime later. A prospective purchaser of property that has been recently constructed, altered, or repaired should be cautious about possible unrecorded mechanics' liens against the property.

Judgment
- A judgment is a decree issued by a court. When the decree establishes the amount a debtor owes and provides for money to be awarded, it is called a money judgment. These often result from damages caused to one person by another person through a wrongful act, breach of contract, or nonpayment of a debt.

A judgment is a general, involuntary, equitable lien on both real and personal property owned by the debtor. A judgment is not the same as a mortgage because no specific parcel of real estate was given as security at the time the debt was created. A lien automatically covers only property located within the county in which the judgment is issued, so a notice of the lien must be filed in any county to which a creditor wishes to extend the lien coverage. Judgments expire after a number of years but, in some states, can be renewed indefinitely by the judgment creditor.

To enforce a judgment, the creditor must obtain a writ of execution from the court. A writ of execution directs the sheriff to seize and sell as much of the debtor's property as is necessary to pay both the debt and the expenses of the sale. A judgment does not become a lien against the personal property of a debtor until the creditor orders the sheriff to assess the property and the charge is actually made.

A judgment lien's priority is established by one or a combination of the following (as provided by state law):

Date the judgment was entered by the court
Date the judgment was filed in the recorder's office
Date a writ of execution was issued
When real property is sold to satisfy a debt, the debtor should demand a legal document known as a satisfaction of judgment (or satisfaction piece). Filing the satisfaction of judgment clears the record of the lien. In those states using a deed of trust, a deed of reconveyance must be filed with either the clerk of the court or, in some states, the recorder of deeds.

Lis Pendens
- There is often a considerable delay between the time a lawsuit is filed and the time final judgment is rendered. When any suit that affects title to or possession of real estate is filed, a special notice, known as a lis pendens is recorded. A lis pendens is not itself a lien, but rather notice of a possible future lien. Recording a lis pendens notifies prospective purchasers and lenders that there is a potential claim against the property. It also establishes a priority for the later lien. The lien is backdated to the recording date of the lis pendens.

Attachment
- To prevent a debtor from conveying title to previously unsecured real estate while a court suit is being decided, a creditor may seek a writ of attachment. A writ of attachment is a court order against the property of another person that directs the sheriff or other officer of the court to seize or take control of a property. By this writ, the court retains custody of the property until the suit concludes. Most attachments arise from an action for payment of an unsecured debt. For example, a plaintiff in a lawsuit may attach a defendant's property to gain a security interest in order to foreclose the property or to prevent the defendant from disposing of property that may be needed to pay a judgment.

Estate and Inheritance Tax Liens
- Federal estate taxes and state inheritance taxes (as well as the debts of decedents) are general, statutory, involuntary liens that encumber a deceased person's real and personal property. These taxes and debts are normally paid or cleared in probate court proceedings.

Liens for Municipal Utilities
- Municipalities often have the right to impose a specific, equitable, involuntary lien on the property of an owner who refuses to pay bills for municipal utility services.

Bail Bond Liens
- A real estate owner who is charged with a crime that will result in a trial may post bail in the form of real estate rather than cash. The execution and recording of such a bail bond creates a specific, statutory, voluntary lien against the owner's real estate. If the accused fails to appear in court, the lien may be enforced by the sheriff or another court officer.

Corporation Franchise Tax
- State governments generally levy a corporation franchise tax on corporations as a condition of allowing them to do business in the state. Such a tax is a general, statutory, involuntary lien on all real and personal property owned by the corporation.

IRS Tax Lien
- A federal tax lien, or Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax lien, results from a person's failure to pay any portion of federal taxes, such as income and withholding taxes. A federal tax lien is a general, statutory, involuntary lien on all real and personal property held by the delinquent taxpayer. Its priority, however, is based on the date of filing or recording; it does not supersede previously recorded liens. The same rules apply to most state income tax liens.
