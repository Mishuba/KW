Housing Affordability

    Those who choose home ownership over renting must evaluate many factors before they decide to purchase property. And the purchasing decision must be weighed carefully in light of each individual's financial circumstances.

    The decision to buy or to rent property involves considering

        how long a person wants to live in a particular area,
        a person's financial situation,
        housing affordability,
        current mortgage interest rates,
        tax consequences of owning versus renting property, and
        what might happen to home prices and tax laws in the future.
        Unfortunately, recent history has shown that there are those who will commit mortgage fraud in applying for a home loan by exaggerating income or assets, minimizing or concealing debt obligations, or providing a false employment history. Loan applicants have also been victims of predatory lending practices that result in too-high loan fees and abusive interest rates. To help curb such practices, HUD now certifies housing counselors to assist borrowers in knowing their responsibilities and rights.

    Mortgage terms 
        Mortgage terms and payment plans are two of the biggest factors when deciding whether to own or rent a home. Although many loan programs of the past are no longer offered or are offered only to highly qualified borrowers, mortgages on less stringent terms are still available to those who qualify. The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), for example, have programs with low down payments and lower credit score requirements. They, too, have tightened lending standards in recent years.

    Ownership expenses and ability to pay 
        Home ownership involves many expenses, including utility costs, such as electricity, natural gas, heating oil, water, trash removal, and sewer charges, in addition to routine maintenance and repairs. Owners also must pay real estate taxes, buy property insurance, and repay (with interest) the mortgage loan used to purchase the property—what lenders refer to as PITI (principal, interest, taxes, and insurance).
        To determine what a prospective buyer can afford, most home mortgage lenders use a computerized underwriting system that considers various factors, including the loan applicant's credit report and credit score. There are three major credit reporting companies in the United States: Equifax (www.equifax.com), Experian (www.experian.com), and TransUnion (www.transunion.com).

        Checking Your Credit Report 
            The credit report is important in acquiring a loan for a home or other major purchase, obtaining a credit card, being approved for a lease, and even in acquiring a new job. Because of its significance to the consumer in so many ways, the federal government requires each of the major credit reporting companies to make a free copy of the report available annually to every consumer for whom a report is available. The free reports can be obtained at www.annualcreditreport.com. (Don't be confused by similarly named sites that charge for this service.) Because each of the credit reporting agencies is required to comply with the law, the consumer can request a free report every four months from a different company each time, making it possible to monitor one's credit status on a regular basis.

        A credit score is prepared by a credit reporting company and is based on a consumer's past history of credit use, including income, outstanding loans, number of credit accounts open, outstanding credit lines, number of accounts opened and closed, payment history, and credit inquiries. The credit score, often called the FICO score because it can be created from software developed by Fair Isaac and Company, can range from a low of 300 to a high of 850, the best score. Lenders will require a minimum credit score for a loan, often dependent on whether or not the lender will sell the mortgage after initiating it or the borrower is making use of a government-sponsored program, such as those of FHA and VA
        Lenders generally look at a loan applicant's percentage of debt to income (DTI). A homebuyer who is able to provide at least 10% of the purchase price as a down payment, for instance, could be expected to incur a monthly PITI payment of no more than 28% of the borrower's gross (pretax) monthly income. Monthly payments on all debts—normally including long-term debt such as car payments, student loans, or other mortgages—would be expected to not exceed 36% of gross monthly income. Expenses such as insurance premiums, utilities, and routine medical care would not be included in the 36% figure but would be expected to be covered by the remaining 64% of the buyer's monthly income. The formula can vary, depending on the type of loan program and the borrower's earnings, credit history, number of dependents, and other factors. The borrower's credit score now plays a key role in the lending decision, though the debt-to-income ratio is still important.

            Practice using this 
                A prospective homebuyer wants to know how much to budget for a purchase. The buyer has a gross monthly income of $5,000. If the required down payment can be made, the buyer's allowable housing expense may be calculated as follows:
                    $5,000 gross monthly income × 28% = $1,400 total housing expense allowed
                    $5,000 gross monthly income × 36% = $1,800 total housing and other debt expense allowed

        If actual monthly non-housing debts exceed 8% of gross income (36%–28%), and the borrower is unable to reduce that amount, the monthly payment must be lowered proportionately because the debts and housing payment combined cannot exceed 36% of gross monthly income. Lower debts would not result in a higher allowable housing payment, but would be considered a factor for approval.
        The lender will also consider the loan-to-value ratio (LTV), which is the amount of the loan as a percentage of the purchase price of the property. If a borrower makes a down payment of 10% of the purchase price and borrows the rest, the LTV is 90%. The lower the LTV (the greater the down payment), the less risk is assumed by the lender.

Promissory Note
        The purchase of a home usually requires borrowing a substantial amount—or all—of the purchase price. In exchange for a lender providing the needed funds, the borrower promises to repay the debt with interest

        The promissory note, called the note or financing instrument, is a borrower's personal promise to repay a debt according to the agreed terms. A promissory note executed by a borrower (the maker or payor) is a contract with the lender (the payee). The note generally states the amount of the debt, the time and method of payment, and the rate of interest. When signed by the borrower and other necessary parties, the note becomes a legally enforceable and fully negotiable instrument of debt. When the terms of the note are satisfied, the debt is discharged. If the terms of the note are not met, the lender may foreclose on any property that was used as security for the debt. When a note is unsecured (there is no collateral provided for the debt), the lender can sue to collect on the note.

        A note is a negotiable instrument, similar to a check or bank draft. The payee who holds the note may transfer the right to receive payment to a third party in one of two ways:
            By signing the instrument over (that is, by assigning it) to the third party
            By delivering the instrument to the third party

    Interest 
        Interest is a charge for the use of money, expressed as a percentage of the remaining balance of the loan. A lender charges interest on the principal (amount borrowed that has not yet been repaid) over the term of the loan, usually monthly. Interest may be due at either the end or the beginning of each payment period. Payments made at the end of a period are known as payments in arrears. This payment method is the general practice, and home loans often call for end-of-period payments due on the first of the following month. Payments may also be made at the beginning of each period and are known as payments in advance. Whether interest is charged in arrears or in advance is specified in the note. This distinction is important if the property is sold before the debt is repaid in full.

    Usury 
        Charging interest in excess of the maximum rate allowed by law is called usury. To protect consumers from unscrupulous lenders, many states have enacted laws limiting the interest rate that may be charged on loans. In some states, a lender that makes a usurious loan is permitted to collect the borrowed money, but only at the legal rate of interest. In others, a usurious lender may lose the right to collect any interest or may lose the entire amount of the loan in addition to the interest.
        As of March 31, 1980, federal law exempts federally related residential first mortgage loans made after that date from state usury laws. A federally related transaction is one that involves a federally chartered or insured lending institution or an agency of the federal government. Because federal law always preempts state law on the same subject, the federal law means that most home loans are not subject to state usury protections. Private lenders are still subject to state usury laws, however.

    Loan Origination Fee 
        The processing of a mortgage application is known as loan origination. When a home loan is originated, a loan origination fee, or transfer fee, is charged by most lenders to cover the expenses involved in generating the loan. These expenses include the loan officer's salary and the lender's other costs of doing business. A loan origination fee is not prepaid interest; rather, it is a charge that must be paid to the lender. The loan origination fee will vary, depending on how competitive a lender chooses to be, but typically is about 1% of the loan amount.
            In Practice
                Because many real estate loans are made by private loan companies that may not be covered by federal regulations, it is important that a borrower insist on receiving a statement in advance from the lender that clearly states the total amount of the loan closing costs and the effective interest rate, in order to avoid unpleasant surprises at closing.

    Discount points 
        Discount points are used to increase the lender's yield (rate of return) on its investment. For example, the interest rate that a lender charges for a loan might be less than the yield an investor demands. To make up the difference, the lender charges the borrower discount points. The number of points charged depends on two factors:
            1.) The difference between the loan's stated interest rate and the yield required by the lender
            2.) How long the lender expects it will take the borrower to pay off the loan
                Math
                    For borrowers, one discount point equals 1% of the loan amount (not purchase price) and is charged as prepaid interest at the closing. For instance, three discount points charged on a $100,000 loan would be $3,000, which is $100,000 × 3%, or $100,000 × 0.03. If a house sells for $100,000 and the borrower seeks an $80,000 loan, each point would be $800, not $1,000. The points in a new acquisition may be paid in cash at closing by the buyer (or, of course, by the seller on the buyer's behalf, as negotiated by the parties) rather than being financed as part of the total loan amount.
                    To determine how many points are charged on a loan, divide the total dollar amount of the points by the amount of the loan. For example, if the loan amount is $350,000 and the charge for points is $9,275, how many points are being charged?
                        $9,275 ÷ $350,000 = 0.0265 or 2.65% or 2.65 points

    Prepayment penalty 
        Most mortgage loans are paid in installments over a long period of time. As a result, the total interest paid by the borrower may add up to more than the principal amount of the loan. That does not come as a surprise to the lender; the total amount of accrued interest is carefully calculated during the origination phase to determine the profitability of each loan. If the borrower repays the loan before the end of the term, the lender collects less than the anticipated interest. For this reason, some mortgage notes contain a prepayment clause. This clause requires that the borrower pay a prepayment penalty against the unearned portion of the interest for any payments made ahead of schedule, typically during the first years of the loan. This gives the lender the assurance of a certain level of income earned on the loan.
        Lenders may not charge prepayment penalties on mortgage loans insured or guaranteed by the federal government or on those loans that have been sold on the secondary mortgage market to one of the government-sponsored enterprises, such as Fannie Mae.
    
Security Instrument 
    Mortgage loans are secured loans. Mortgage loans have two parts: the debt itself and the security for the debt. When a property is mortgaged, the owner must execute (sign) two separate instruments—the financing instrument that creates the debt and the security instrument that specifies the property that the debtor will use as collateral for the debt. The financing instrument is the promissory note (discussed earlier), which states the amount owed. Depending on the state, the security instrument will take the form of either a mortgage or a deed of trust, though both are commonly referred to as a mortgage, and will specify the property used to secure the loan. A mortgage creates a lien on the property; the deed of trust actually transfers legal title from the borrower to a third party to hold on behalf of the lender while the borrower's debt is still outstanding. This section looks at the differences in how each form of security interest is created and how each is enforced.
    A basic principle of property law is that no one can convey more than he actually owns. This principle also applies to a mortgage. The owner of a fee simple estate can mortgage the fee. The owner of a leasehold or subleasehold can mortgage that leasehold interest. The owner of a condominium unit can mortgage the fee interest in the condominium. Even the owner of a cooperative unit may be able to offer that property interest (the owner's stock in the underlying corporation) as security for a loan.

    Hypothecation 
        In mortgage lending practice, a borrower is required to make specific real property security (collateral) for the loan. In the process called hypothecation, the debtor retains the right of possession and control of the secured property, while the creditor receives an equitable right in the property. The right to foreclose on the property in the event a borrower defaults is contained in the security agreement, which takes the form of either a mortgage or a deed of trust, as discussed next.

    Mortgage 
        A mortgage is a lien on the real property of a debtor. The borrower, or mortgagor, receives a loan and in return gives a promissory note and mortgage to the lender, called the mortgagee. The mortgage is a voluntary, specific lien. If the debtor defaults, the lender can sue on the note and foreclose on the mortgage. When the loan is paid in full, the mortgagee issues a document called a satisfaction of mortgage, which can be filed in the public record as evidence of the removal of the security interest, which would otherwise continue to be an encumbrance on the ownership interest of the borrower. The judicial process for foreclosure of a mortgage depends on state law and on whether the state treats the mortgage as a lien or as a conveyance of some part of the title to the property.
        In a mortgage or lien theory state, the mortgagor retains both legal and equitable title to property that serves as security for a debt. The mortgagee has a lien on the property but the mortgage is nothing more than collateral for the loan. If the mortgagor defaults, the mortgagee must go through a formal foreclosure proceeding in court to obtain legal title. If the foreclosure is approved by the court, the property is offered for sale at public auction, and the funds from the sale are used to pay the balance of the remaining debt. In some states, a defaulting mortgagor may redeem (buy back) the property during a certain period after the sale, the statutory right of redemption. A borrower who fails to redeem the property during that time loses the property irrevocably. See  Mortgages for a diagram of how a mortgage works.

    Deed of Trust 
        In some states, lenders prefer to use a three-party security instrument known as a deed of trust. A trust deed conveys bare legal title (naked title)—that is, title without the right of possession—from the borrower to a third party, called the trustee. The trustee holds legal title on behalf of the lender, the holder of the promissory note, who is known as the beneficiary. On full payment of the underlying debt, the lender/beneficiary notifies the trustee, who returns legal title to the trustor.
        In a deed of trust or title theory state, such as Arizona, the borrower is the trustor who conveys legal title to the trustee but retains equitable title and the right of possession. Legal title is returned to the borrower/trustor only when the debt is paid in full (or some other obligation is performed).
        The deed of trust establishes the actions that the trustee may take if the borrower, the trustor, defaults under any of the deed of trust terms. In states where deeds of trust are generally preferred, foreclosure procedures for default, which must comply with state law, are usually simpler and faster than for mortgage loans. On notification of the borrower's default, the trustee is authorized to sell the secured property, providing the proceeds to the beneficiary, the lender. If the sale proceeds are greater than the amount owed on the debt, the borrower receives the difference, less penalty fees and court costs.
        Usually, the lender chooses the trustee and reserves the right to substitute trustees in the event of the trustee's death or dismissal. State law usually dictates who may serve as trustee. Although the deed of trust is particularly popular in certain states, it is used all over the country. See  Deed of Trust for a diagram of how a deed of trust works.

        A mortgage or deed of trust must clearly establish that the property is security for a debt, identify the lender and the borrower, and include an accurate legal description of the property. Both instruments incorporate the terms of the promissory note by reference, which coordinates the note and security instrument, and both should be signed by all parties who have an interest in the real estate.

    Duties of the borrower 
        The borrower—whether a mortgagor or a trustor—is required to fulfill certain obligations created by the mortgage or deed of trust. These usually include the following:

            Payment of the debt in accordance with the terms of the promissory note
            Payment of all real estate taxes on the property used as security
            Maintenance of adequate insurance to protect the lender in the event that the property is destroyed or damaged by fire, windstorm, or other hazard
            Maintenance of the property in good repair at all times
            Receipt of lender authorization before making any major alterations on the property

        Failure to meet any of these obligations can result in a borrower's default. The loan documents may, however, provide for a grace period (such as 30 days) during which the borrower can meet the obligation and cure the default. If the borrower does not do so, the lender has the right to take the steps described next.

    Provisions for default 
        The mortgage or deed of trust typically includes an acceleration clause to assist the lender in foreclosure. If a borrower defaults, the lender has the right to accelerate the maturity of the debt. This means the lender may declare the entire principal balance due and payable immediately. Without an acceleration clause, the lender would have to sue the borrower every time a payment was overdue.
        Other provisions in a mortgage or deed of trust enable the lender to take care of the property in the event of the borrower's negligence or default. If the borrower does not pay taxes or insurance premiums, or fails to make necessary repairs on the property, the lender may step in and do so. The lender has the power to protect the security (the real estate).
            In Practice
                In financing a real estate sale, a lender will seldom accept an unsecured promissory note because there would be no backup for the loan. If a borrower defaulted, the lender would be forced to sue for a money judgment. In the meantime, the debtor might dispose of the property and hide assets. In some states, a money judgment cannot be used to foreclose on a debtor's personal residence. Because of these, and other reasons, lenders prefer a security interest in real property.

    Assignment of the mortgage 
        As noted earlier, a promissory note usually is a negotiable instrument. This means that, without changing the provisions of the contract, the note may be sold to a third party, such as an investor or another mortgage company. The original mortgagee (the assignor) endorses the note to the third party (the assignee) and executes an assignment of mortgage. The assignee becomes the new owner of the debt and security instrument. When the debt is paid in full (or satisfied), the assignee is required to execute the document that releases the security interest.

    Release of the mortgage lien or deed of trust 
            When all loan payments have been made and the promissory note has been paid in full, the borrower will want the public record to show that the debt has been satisfied and that the lender is divested of all rights conveyed under the mortgage or deed of trust. By the provisions of the defeasance clause in the financing instrument, the lender is required to execute a satisfaction of mortgage (also known as a release or discharge) when the note has been fully paid. This document returns to the borrower all interest in the real estate originally conveyed to the lender. Entering this release in the public record shows that the debt has been removed from the property.
            When a real estate loan secured by a deed of trust has been completely repaid, the beneficiary must make a written request that the trustee convey the title to the property back to the grantor. The trustee executes and delivers a deed of reconveyance (sometimes called a release deed) to the trustor. The deed to the trustor conveys the same rights and powers that the trustee was given under the deed of trust. It should include a notarized acknowledgment and be recorded in the public records of the county in which the property is located.
            If the mortgage or deed of trust has been assigned, the satisfaction of mortgage or reconveyance deed must be executed and recorded by the assignee or mortgagee.

    Tax and Insurance Reserves 
        As discussed previously, many lenders require that borrowers provide a reserve fund to meet future real estate taxes and property insurance premiums. This fund is called an impound or escrow account. When the mortgage or deed of trust loan is made, the borrower starts the reserve by depositing funds to cover the amount of unpaid real estate taxes. If a new insurance policy has just been purchased, the insurance premium reserve will be started with the deposit of one-twelfth of the insurance premium liability. The borrower's monthly loan payments will include PITI: principal, interest, taxes, and insurance. Other costs also may be included, such as flood insurance. Federal regulations limit the total amount of reserves that a lender may require.
            In Practice
                The borrower should make sure that property taxes and insurance payments have been made by the holder of an impound account by their respective due dates. The borrower should also keep track of any increases in taxes or insurance payments, in order to deposit a sufficient amount into the impound account.

    Flood Insurance Reserves 
        The National Flood Insurance Reform Act of 1994 imposes certain mandatory obligations on lenders and loan servicers to set aside (escrow) funds for flood insurance on new loans for property in flood-prone areas. This means that if a lender or servicer discovers that a secured property is in a flood hazard area, it must notify the borrower. The borrower then has 45 days to purchase flood insurance. If the borrower fails to procure flood insurance, the lender must purchase the insurance on the borrower's behalf. The cost of the insurance may be charged back to the borrower. More information on flood insurance, which can be a critical part of home ownership, is provided later.

    Buying "subject to" or assuming a seller's mortgage or deed of trust 
        When a person purchases real estate that has an outstanding mortgage or deed of trust, the buyer may take the property in one of two ways. The property may be purchased "subject to" the mortgage or deed of trust, or by assumption of mortgage, in which the buyer assumes the mortgage or deed of trust and agrees to pay the debt. This technical distinction becomes important if the buyer defaults and the mortgage or deed of trust is foreclosed.
        When the property is sold subject to the mortgage, the buyer is not personally obligated to pay the debt in full. The buyer takes title to the real estate knowing that she must make payments on the existing loan. Upon default, the lender forecloses and the property is sold by court order to pay the debt. If the sale does not pay off the entire debt, the purchaser is not liable for the difference. In some circumstances, however, the original seller might continue to be liable.
        In contrast, a buyer who purchases a property and assumes the seller's debt becomes personally obligated for the payment of the entire debt. If a seller wants to be completely free of the original mortgage loan, the seller(s), buyer(s), and lender must execute a novation agreement in writing. The novation makes the buyer solely responsible for any default on the loan. The original borrower (seller) is freed of any liability for the loan.
        The existence of a lien does not prevent the transfer of property; however, when a secured loan is assumed, the mortgagee or beneficiary must approve the assumption and any release of liability of the original mortgagor or trustor. Because a loan may not be assumed without lender approval, the lending institution would require the assumer to qualify financially, and many lending institutions charge a transfer fee to cover the costs of changing the records. This charge can be paid by either the buyer or the seller.

    Alienation clause 
        The lender may want to prevent a future purchaser of the property from being able to assume the loan, particularly if the original interest rate is low. For this reason, most lenders include an alienation clause (also known as a resale clause, due-on-sale clause, or call clause) in the note. An alienation clause provides that when the property is sold, the lender may either declare the entire debt due immediately or permit the buyer to assume the loan at an interest rate acceptable to the lender. Land contracts that involve a due-on-sale clause also limit the assumption of the contract.

    Recording a mortgage or deed of trust 
        The mortgage document or deed of trust must be recorded in the recorder's office of the county in which the real estate is located. Recording gives constructive notice to the world of the borrower's obligations. Recording also establishes the lien's priority. If the property is registered in the Torrens system, notice of the lien must be entered on the original Torrens certificate.

    Priority of a mortgage of deed of trust
        Priority of mortgages and other liens normally is determined by the order in which they were recorded. A mortgage or deed of trust on land that has no prior mortgage lien is a first mortgage or first deed of trust. If the owner later executes another loan for additional funds, the new loan becomes a second mortgage or second deed of trust (or a junior lien) when it is recorded. Second loans represent greater risk to the lender, and they usually have a higher interest rate.
        In the event that a second lien has a higher amount than the first, the lender may require a subordination agreement, in which the first lender subordinates or lowers its lien position to that of the second lender. To be valid, both lenders must sign the agreement.
